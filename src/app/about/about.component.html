<h2>About Us</h2>
<img [src]="fullImagePath2">

<p>The Timber Tigers Hiking Club was established in 2017 when an unassuming group of friends decided to embark on a 17 mile hike and enjoyed themselves so thoroughly that they created the club and coined the name. We tackle trails of all difficulty levels, althouth prefer ones with a generous view! Everyone of all ages and skill levels are welcome!</p>
